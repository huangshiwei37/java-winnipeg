To read in data from the cosole, the commands are slightly more complicated for Java. 
We will be using a class for input called Scanner. When using Scanner for input, you need the following line at the top of your application:

import java.util.Scanner;

1. To read in a number from the console, you need to use the nextInt() command, similar to the following:
int firstNumber;

Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
firstNumber = in.nextInt();

2. To read in text data from the console, you need to use the next() command, similar to the following:
String userName;

Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
username = in.next();
