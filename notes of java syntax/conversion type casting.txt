1. implicit casting: from a type with less bits to another type with more bits

int a = 100;
float b = a; // implicit casting
double c = b; // implicit casting

2. explicit casting: from a type with more bits to another type with less bits

double d = 100.0;
float f = (float) d; // explicit casting
int a = (int) f; // explicit casting
