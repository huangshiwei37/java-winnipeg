Question 1


Write a class called Calculator that performs the following calculator operations:
* Adds two numbers together and returns the result.
* Subtracts one number from another and returns the result
* Multiples two numbers and returns the result
* Divides one number from another and returns the result


Make everything in the class static. Additionally, add a function called LastResult which returns the last result that was calculated by any of the functions.


In your main class, write a control loop that asks for the following options:
* 1 - Add two numbers
* 2 - Subtract two numbers
* 3 - Multiplies two numbers
* 4 - Divides two numbers
* 5 - Shows the last result
* 6 - Quit


Question 2


Write a class called InputFromKeyboard that will print out a prompt, and get input from the keyboard using the Scanner class. It should have three functions:


* getString - Takes a string for a prompt, prints out the prompt, and returns a string entered by keyboard.
* getInt - Takes a string for a prompt, prints out the prompt, and returns an integer entered by keyboard.
* getDouble - Takes a string for a prompt, prints out the prompt, and returns a double entered by keyboard.


Have all of these methods be static. As a bonus, try to make the scanner instance also be static, so that you do not need to create a new instance every time you need to use it.


In your main class, use the InputFromKeyboard class to ask for the user’s name, age, and account balance. Print out all the collected information.
