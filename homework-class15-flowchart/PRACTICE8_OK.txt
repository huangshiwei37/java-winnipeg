Develop a program that generates invoices for customers and purchase orders from suppliers.


The system displays a menu asking if you want to make an invoice or purchase order.
* In case of an invoice, the program asks for the client’s data
* In case of a purchase order, the program asks for the supplier’s data
Then the program asks to enter up to 10 items (may be less) with description and its value


At the end, the program calculates the net total, GST, PST and finally shows on screen all the data of the invoice or purchase order. It displays one piece of data per line:


* Invoice Number / Purchase Order Number
* Customer number / Supplier Number
* Customer name / Supplier Name
————————
* Items with the value of each
———————- 
* Net total
* GST
* PST
* Final total
